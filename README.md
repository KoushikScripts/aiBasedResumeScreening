The system works by processing PDF resumes and scoring them based on various features such as formatting, content relevance, and overall readability.

## Features
- **Resume Scoring**: Automatically assigns a score to resumes based on their quality.
- **Suggestions**: Provides actionable suggestions to improve the resume, such as enhancing content or reformatting sections.
