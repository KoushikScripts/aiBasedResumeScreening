# Resume Scoring and Suggestion Model

This project implements a machine learning model to score and suggest improvements for resumes. The model evaluates resumes based on a dataset of resumes and generates suggestions for enhancing their quality. The system works by processing PDF resumes and scoring them based on various features such as formatting, content relevance, and overall readability.

## Features
- **Resume Scoring**: Automatically assigns a score to resumes based on their quality.
- **Suggestions**: Provides actionable suggestions to improve the resume, such as enhancing content or reformatting sections.
- **PDF Input**: Accepts resumes in PDF format for analysis.
- **CSV Dataset**: Uses a CSV dataset of resumes for model training and evaluation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-scoring-suggestion-model.git
   cd resume-scoring-suggestion-model
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install additional dependencies for PDF processing:
   ```bash
   pip install PyPDF2
   ```

## Usage

### Step 1: Preparing the Dataset
Ensure you have a CSV dataset containing resume information for model training. The dataset should have columns like `Resume Text`, `Score`, and any other relevant features.

### Step 2: Running the Model
To evaluate a resume and generate suggestions, run the following script:

```python
from resume_scoring_model import evaluate_resume

# Path to your PDF resume
resume_path = 'path/to/your/resume.pdf'

# Evaluate the resume
score, suggestions = evaluate_resume(resume_path)

print(f"Resume Score: {score}")
print("Suggestions for Improvement:")
for suggestion in suggestions:
    print(f"- {suggestion}")
```

### Step 3: Training the Model
If you'd like to train the model with your own dataset, run:

```python
from resume_scoring_model import train_model

# Path to your CSV dataset
dataset_path = 'path/to/your/dataset.csv'

# Train the model
train_model(dataset_path)
```
